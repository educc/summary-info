# 1. Structure of an Angular Application
- An Angular application is a collection of components.
- Components are the building blocks of Angular applications.
- Components can be nested to create complex UIs.

# 2. Angular Lifecycle
- An Angular component has a lifecycle that is triggered by events such as creation, destruction, and change detection.
- The lifecycle allows developers to control how a component behaves at different stages of its life.

# 3. Angular Modules
- An Angular module is a collection of related components, directives, pipes, and services.
- Modules are used to organize code and make it easier to manage.

# 4. Angular Components
- An Angular component is a TypeScript class that defines the behavior and appearance of a UI element.
- Components can be used to create reusable UI elements.

# 5. Pipes and Directives
- Angular pipes are used to transform data.
- Angular directives are used to add new functionality to elements.

# 6. Dependency Injection
- Angular dependency injection is a technique for injecting dependencies into components.
- Dependency injection makes it easier to test components and makes code more modular.

# 7. Reactive using Observable and RxJS
- Angular reactive programming is a technique for handling asynchronous data.
- Reactive programming makes it easier to handle large amounts of data and makes code more responsive.

# 8. Routing
- Angular routing is a technique for navigating between different pages in an Angular application.
- Routing makes it easier to create single-page applications.

# 9. Security
- Angular security is a set of features that help to protect Angular applications from security vulnerabilities.
- Angular security features include:
  - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection
  - Content security policy (CSP) support
  - Https only mode

# 10. Common Angular Services 
- The HTTP service for making HTTP requests
- The Location service for getting and setting the browser's location
- The Cookie service for managing cookies
- The Storage service for storing data in the browser's local storage

# 1. Layered Architecture

## 1.1. Characteristics
- The system is divided into a number of layers, each of which is responsible for a specific set of tasks.
- The layers are loosely coupled, which makes it easy to add or remove layers.
- The layers communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces.

## 1.2. Pros
- Easy to understand and manage.
- Scalable.
- Fault tolerant.

## 1.3. Cons
- Can be complex to design and implement.
- Not as efficient as some other architectures.

# 2. Event-Driven Architecture

## 2.1. Characteristics
- The system is event-driven, which means that it reacts to events that occur in the environment.
- Events are published to a central event bus.
- Consumers subscribe to events on the event bus.

## 2.2. Pros
- Highly scalable.
- Fault tolerant.
- Easy to add or remove components.

## 2.3. Cons
- Can be complex to design and implement.
- Not as efficient as some other architectures.

# 3. Microkernel Architecture

## 3.1. Characteristics
- The core functionality of the system is implemented in a small, central kernel.
- All other functionality is implemented in independent modules.
- The modules communicate with the kernel through well-defined interfaces.

## 3.2. Pros
- Highly modular.
- Easy to add or remove modules.
- Fault tolerant.

## 3.3. Cons
- Can be complex to design and implement.
- Not as efficient as some other architectures.

# 4. Microservices Architecture Pattern

## 4.1. Characteristics
- The system is composed of a collection of small, independent services.
- Each service is responsible for a specific business function.
- The services communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces.

## 4.2. Pros
- Highly scalable.
- Fault tolerant.
- Easy to add or remove services.

## 4.3. Cons
- Can be complex to design and implement.
- Not as efficient as some other architectures.

# 5. Space-Based Architecture

## 5.1. Characteristics
- The system is divided into a number of logical spaces.
- Each space is responsible for a specific set of data.
- The spaces communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces.

## 5.2. Pros
- Highly scalable.
- Fault tolerant.
- Easy to add or remove spaces.

## 5.3. Cons
- Can be complex to design and implement.
- Not as efficient as some other architectures.
